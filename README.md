# Horiseon Website Project

## Created this website as part of the weekly challenge in my bootcamp and decided to build it for accessibility reasons. We solved how to make text accessible. I learned that adding alt text to images is useful and makes search optimization better.

## table of contents 
- search engine optimization
- online reptuation management 
- social media marketing 

## how to install
simply clone the git repo to your local desktop and open vscode to begin editing and save the changes 

## usage 
simply meant to be viewed at

## credits 
My friend Ethan Hinds helped me work with the formatting of the code.
